# FFXIV Crafting Optimizer Website

This project contains the source for the [FFXIV Crafting Optimizer Website](http://ffxiv.lokyst.net/). 
It uses [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), [AngularUI Bootstrap](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/), 
and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

I'm experimenting with the expectimax algorithm to create optimal crafting instructions.

**This app is currently non-functional. The biggest problem is the amount of time it takes to run the algorithm - I'm considering moving it to C++.**

### Running the app during development

You can pick one of these options:

* serve this repository with your webserver
* install node.js and run `scripts/web-server.js`

Then navigate your browser to `http://localhost:<port>/app/index.html` to see the app running in
your browser.
