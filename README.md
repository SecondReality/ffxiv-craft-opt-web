# FFXIV Crafting Optimizer Website

This project contains the source for the [FFXIV Crafting Optimizer Website](http://ffxiv.lokyst.net/). 
It uses [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), [AngularUI Bootstrap](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/), 
and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

I'm experimenting with the expectimax algorithm to create optimal crafting instructions.
